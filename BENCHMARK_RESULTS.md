# Connection Cache Benchmark Results

## Test Configuration
- **Total Connections per test**: 500
- **Concurrent Connections**: 25  
- **Test Type**: TCP Proxy with Echo Server
- **Cache Sizes Tested**: 0KB (no cache), 128KB, 1MB, 8MB
- **Environment**: Linux, Tokio async runtime

## Results Summary

| Cache Size | Total Connections | Avg Connection Time (ms) | Total Duration (ms) | Throughput (RPS) | Success Rate (%) |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| No Cache   | 500               | 2.89                    | 77.00               | 6,493.51         | 100.0            |
| 128KB      | 500               | 1.71                    | 50.00               | 10,000.00        | 100.0            |
| 1MB        | 500               | 1.84                    | 52.00               | 9,615.38         | 100.0            |
| 8MB        | 500               | 1.55                    | 47.00               | 10,638.30        | 100.0            |

## Key Findings

### 1. Performance Improvement with Caching
- **No Cache**: 6,493.51 RPS baseline
- **Best Performance**: 8MB cache with 10,638.30 RPS (**63.8% improvement**)
- **Minimum Improvement**: 128KB cache with 10,000.00 RPS (**54.0% improvement**)

### 2. Connection Time Reduction
- **No Cache**: Average 2.89ms per connection
- **Best**: 8MB cache with 1.55ms per connection (**46.4% reduction**)
- All cache configurations significantly reduced connection establishment time

### 3. Optimal Cache Size Analysis
- **8MB cache** provided the best overall performance:
  - Highest throughput: 10,638.30 RPS
  - Lowest average connection time: 1.55ms
  - Fastest total execution time: 47ms

### 4. Diminishing Returns Analysis
- **128KB → 1MB**: Minor performance degradation (-384.62 RPS, -3.8%)
- **1MB → 8MB**: Significant performance gain (+1,022.92 RPS, +10.6%)
- **Sweet spot**: Appears to be between 1MB-8MB for this workload

## Recommendations

1. **Production Use**: Implement 8MB connection cache for optimal performance
2. **Memory Constrained Environments**: 128KB cache still provides 54% improvement over no caching
3. **High Throughput Applications**: Connection caching provides substantial benefits with 63% throughput improvement
4. **Connection Pooling**: The results suggest connection reuse significantly reduces TCP handshake overhead

## Technical Implementation Notes

The benchmark simulates realistic proxy usage with:
- Concurrent connection handling (25 simultaneous connections)
- Echo server for bidirectional data transfer
- Connection establishment and data transfer timing
- Memory-based connection caching with size limits

## Next Steps

1. Test with real-world traffic patterns
2. Implement connection timeout and cleanup mechanisms  
3. Benchmark with different target server response times
4. Test cache performance under sustained load
5. Implement adaptive cache sizing based on traffic patterns
